# Assignment 2: Python Tasks  

# Description  
This repository contains two Python programs:  

1. **TASK1.py – Check if a Number is Even or Odd**  
   - The program takes an integer as input.  
   - It checks whether the number is **even** or **odd** using the modulus operator.  
   - It prints the result.  

2. **TASK2.py – Sum of Integers from 1 to 50**  
   - The program calculates the sum of all integers between **1 and 50**.  
   - It uses a `for` loop to add the numbers sequentially.  
   - It prints the final sum.  

# Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries required  

# How to Run  

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.  
2. Run the desired script using: 

cmd
   python TASK1_assignment2.py
   python TASK2_assignment2.py 

TASK1_assignment2.py:
`C:\Users\tptwi\PycharmProjects\PythonProject2\.venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\tptwi\PycharmProjects\PythonProject-2\Task1_assighment2.py 
Enter a number: 5
5 is an odd number

and TASK2_assignment2.py: 

C:\Users\tptwi\PycharmProjects\PythonProject2\.venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\tptwi\PycharmProjects\PythonProject-2\Task2_assighment2.py 
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
